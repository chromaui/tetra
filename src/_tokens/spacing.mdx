# Spacing

We are using spacing pretty token pretty much in all components. All values are saved in rem units, which means that they are relative to the font size of the root element. This way, the spacing will scale with the font size. The values are proportional, so **`16`** is twice as much spacing as **`8`** for example. One spacing unit is equal to **`0.25rem`**, which translates to **`4px`** by default in common browsers.

<Stack marginTop={8} />

<Spacings
  list={Object.entries(spacing).map(([key, value]) => ({
    name: key,
    value: value,
  }))}
/>
